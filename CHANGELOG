Application-Path in the request resolver for static assets.

script. Installation would continue even if server cannot be installed as a 
service.

* Removed 'SIGCHLD' handler from the worker process - Fixes the incorrect exit 
status issue for a shell command executed using backquote method of ruby.

pointer to a file or a socket fd.

returns NULL value.
