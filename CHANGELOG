v0.2.6 - 23-Dec-2009
--------------------

* Updated messages for HTTP status codes 400, 404, 405, 500 and 501.
* Fixed buffer overflow by allocating enough memory to hold REQUEST_PATH + 
Application-Path in the request resolver for static assets.
* Improved the logic for detection of ruby shared library prerequisite.
* Started using RUBY_INSTALL_NAME for detecting ruby during installation.
* Added validation for search results file created while generating service 
script. Installation would continue even if server cannot be installed as a 
service.
* Corrected example for 'Headers' section in the config file.
* Removed 'SIGCHLD' handler from the worker process - Fixes the incorrect exit 
status issue for a shell command executed using backquote method of ruby.
* Added HTTP Date header when the HTTP response status is 100.
* Used _POSIX_C_SOURCE macro to identify whether the file variable is a 
pointer to a file or a socket fd.
* Corrected return type of 'send_static_worker_pid' method, if YAML parser 
returns NULL value.
* Corrected time slider based analytics graphs issue when they were being seen 
after 2300 hrs.
* Correctly implemented Rack specification for the Response Body. This fixes 
worker crash seen after serving first request in Development Environment mode 
for Rails 2.3.4+ applications.
* Overriding Rack::Deflater to skip response body compression for user-agent 
Internet Explorer 6.0.
* Renamed 'log' message defined by rb_define_singleton_method() to 
'log_message'. This fixes the issue seen when Math.log is called by
number_to_human_size() in a Rails Application. It also fixes the worker crash 
on REE installed with tcmalloc library. (Typically used to result in 404 error 
for a user trying to access the Admin Panel.) Resolves Tickets #9 and #10.
* Code cleanup in Head, Worker and Helper modules.


v0.2.5 - 07-Dec-2009
--------------------

* Tested on Mac OS X v10.6 Snow Leopard & Ubuntu 9.10 (64-bit). 
* Tested on Ruby Enterprise Edition 1.8.7-2009.10.
* Upgraded rack dependency version to >=1.0.1.
* Upgraded rails dependency version to >=2.3.5. Resolves Ticket #6.
* Redirected 'rake spec' output to STDOUT by default to indicate progress 
of test execution.
* Implemented exception handling (that works both on ruby 1.8 & 1.9) for 
handling errors raised in scripts being run by the embedded interpreter in 
the worker.
* Redirected standard IO right after logger is initialized in worker.
* Handled absolute path for install dependencies. Resolves Ticket #3 - 
'Unable to locate gcc on Snow Leopard during installation'.


v0.2.4 - 01-Dec-2009
--------------------

* Fixed intermittent crash issue in head while closing client connections 
by calling close_connection() directly rather than running it through
goodbye_watcher in libebb.
* Renamed on_error callback (introduced by us in libebb) to the more 
appropriate on_request_parse_error.
* Fixed install issue on ruby 1.9 caused due to invalid multibyte char.
* Fixed the incorrect month value in the file name format for gcore dumps.
* Initialized logging for the worker right as it is instantiated before 
it connects to head process.
* Cleaned up wr_wkr_create() method in head/wr_worker.c.
* Print logging level as a string in the log files.
* Fixed invalid pointer being used in 'wr_req_resolve_http_req' function.
* Fixed creation of rack.input stream object. Resolves Ticket #2 related to 
error seen on posting form with enctype="multipart/form-data".
* Ensured 'starling-starling' gem is used by WebROaR even if 'starling' is 
present on the system.

* First cut for public.
