v0.2.5 - ??-Dec-2009
--------------------

* Tested on Ruby Enterprise Edition 1.8.7-2009.10.
* Upgraded rails dependency version to >=2.3.5. Resolves Ticket #6.
* Redirected 'rake spec' output to STDOUT by default to indicate progress

handling errors raised in scripts being run by the embedded interpreter in 
the worker.

* Handled absolute path for install dependencies.


v0.2.4 - 01-Dec-2009
--------------------

* Fixed intermittent crash issue in head while closing client connections 
by calling close_connection() directly rather than running it through
goodbye_watcher in libebb.
* Renamed on_error callback (introduced by us in libebb) to the more 
appropriate on_request_parse_error.
* Fixed install issue on ruby 1.9 caused due to invalid multibyte char.
* Fixed the incorrect month value in the file name format for gcore dumps.
* Initialized logging for the worker right as it is instantiated before 
it connects to head process.

* Print logging level as a string in the log files.
* Fixed invalid pointer being used in 'wr_req_resolve_http_req' function.
* Fixed creation of rack.input stream object. Resolves Ticket #2 related to 
error seen on posting form with enctype="multipart/form-data".
